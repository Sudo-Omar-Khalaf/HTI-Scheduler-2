# GitHub Copilot Configuration for HTI Scheduler

## Remote Indexing Configuration

This project is configured to use GitHub Copilot's remote indexing features for better code suggestions and context awareness.

### Key Features Enabled:

1. **Remote Indexing**: Uses GitHub's remote servers for better context understanding
2. **Codebase Context**: Includes entire codebase context in suggestions
3. **Project Context**: Leverages project-specific patterns and conventions
4. **Experimental Features**: Enables latest Copilot features like temporal context and intent detection

### Configuration Files:

- `.vscode/settings.json`: Project-specific Copilot settings
- `~/.config/Code/User/settings.json`: Global VS Code settings with Copilot configuration

### Benefits of Remote Indexing:

- Better understanding of project structure and patterns
- More accurate code suggestions based on the entire codebase
- Improved context awareness for large projects
- Enhanced performance for complex codebases

### Usage:

1. Ensure GitHub Copilot extension is installed and authenticated
2. Open VS Code in this workspace
3. Remote indexing will automatically begin when the project is opened
4. Look for improved suggestions that understand the full project context

### Troubleshooting:

If remote indexing isn't working:
1. Check your internet connection
2. Verify GitHub Copilot subscription is active
3. Restart VS Code to apply new settings
4. Check VS Code Developer Tools Console for any errors
